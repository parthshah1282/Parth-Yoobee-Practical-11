Degree Days Climate Data Analysis

About

This Python project analyzes a climate data CSV file from the NIWA Climate Database.

We use Python and pandas to read the CSV file, display the first few rows, and generate basic summary statistics.

The CSV file should be placed in the same folder as the Python script.
